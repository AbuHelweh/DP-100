# Lab 4B: Working with Datasets

Datasets provide a way to encapsulate data for experiments and training. You can use tabular and file datasets to define versioned sources of data that can easily be consumed in experiments.

## Before You Start

Before you start this exercise, ensure that you have completed [Lab 1A](Lab01A.md), which includes tasks to create the Azure Machine Learning workspace and compute instance used in this lab. You should also have completed [Lab 4A](Lab04A.md).

## Task 1: Work with Datasets

In this task, you'll use code in a notebook to work with tabular and file datasets.

1. In [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com), view the **Compute** page for your workspace; and on the **Compute Instances** tab, ensure your compute instance is running. If not, start it.
2. When the notebook VM is running, click the **Jupyter** link to open the Jupyter home page in a new browser tab.
3. In the Jupyter home page, in the **DP-100** folder, open the **04B - Working with Datasets.ipynb** notebook. Then read the notes in the notebook, running each code cell in turn.
