# Lab 3B: Training and Registering Models

Machine Learning is primarily about training models that you can use to provide predictive services to applications; so now it;s time to see how you can use Azure Machine Learning experiments to run training scripts, and how to register the resulting trained models.

## Before You Start

Before you start this exercise, ensure that you have completed [Lab 1A](Lab01A.md), which includes tasks to create the Azure Machine Learning workspace and compute instance used in this lab.

## Task 1: Use the Azure Machine Learning SDK to Train and Register Models

In this task, you'll use code in a notebook to run training scripts as Azure Machine Learning experiments.

1. In [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com), view the **Compute** page for your workspace; and on the **Compute Instances** tab, ensure your compute instance is running. If not, start it.
2. When the notebook VM is running, click the **Jupyter** link to open the Jupyter home page in a new browser tab.
3. In the Jupyter home page, in the **DP-100** folder, open the **03B - Training Models.ipynb** notebook. Then read the notes in the notebook, running each code cell in turn.
