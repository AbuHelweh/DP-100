# Lab 5B: Working with Compute Targets

While you can run experiments on your local compute, in many cases you'll want to leverage cloud compute for increased scalability.

## Before You Start

Before you start this exercise, ensure that you have completed [Lab 1A](Lab01A.md), which includes tasks to create the Azure Machine Learning workspace and compute instance used in this lab.

## Task 1: Work with Compute Targets

In this task, you'll run a training experiment on a cloud-based compute target.

1. In [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com), view the **Compute** page for your workspace; and on the **Compute Instances** tab, ensure your compute instance is running. If not, start it.
2. When the notebook VM is running, click the **Jupyter** link to open the Jupyter home page in a new browser tab.
3. In the Jupyter home page, in the **DP-100** folder, open the **05B - Working with Compute Targets.ipynb** notebook. Then read the notes in the notebook, running each code cell in turn.
