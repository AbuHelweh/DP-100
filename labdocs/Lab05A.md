# Lab 5A: Working with Environments

All Python code runs in the context of an environment, which determines the Python packages available. When you run a script as an experiment in Azure Machine Learning, you can configure the environment in which it runs.

## Before You Start

Before you start this exercise, ensure that you have completed [Lab 1A](Lab01A.md), which includes tasks to create the Azure Machine Learning workspace and notebook VM used in this lab.

## Task 1: Work with Environments

In this task, you'll use code in a notebook to work with environments for Azure Machine Learning experiments.

1. In [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com), view the **Compute** page for your workspace; and on the **Notebook VMs** tab, ensure your notebook VM is running. If not, start it.
2. When the notebook VM is running, click the **Jupyter** link to open the Jupyter home page in a new browser tab.
3. In the Jupyter home page, in the **DP-100** folder, open the **05A - Working with Environments.ipynb** notebook. Then read the notes in the notebook, running each code cell in turn.
